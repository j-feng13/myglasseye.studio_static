# About Me

I'm Jonathan, a Chicago based photographer who likes isolation in the city and light rain. 

I primarily shoot with a Nikon D750 a 35mm f/1.8 prime, though; I sometimes carry a F100 and some film.

Reach out at me@myglasseye.studio if you would like to chat, collaborate, or go shooting sometime!
